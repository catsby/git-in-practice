#Another talk on Git?

Yeah, well there's a lot to cover here people.  I'll make it quick and dirty.

In [my previous talk][4] I gave you knowledge on Git in general; how it
does it's magic and introduced you to some basic branching and merging.

On this trip we'll exploring playing nice with others.  Essentially,
I'll review branching and tracking topic branches, demo some interactive
staging/commits, and cover some team based workflows.

Estimated time: 5-7 minutes
